## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
This is my first project practicing with Frontend Mentor, and I am so proud to complete it. I have been practicing my basics of HTML and CSS. I made the structure of the content with HTML, trying to use good practices and semantic ways. I also used CSS to add styles to my project, applying the BEM methodology for improving my organization and development time. I did not completely follow the project exactly, but I have completed the most important features like mobile and desktop styles. I used the same colors, although with a little bit of variation. I am so happy with my work, although I know that I could improve with best practices. For that reason, I am open to any suggestions that you could give me. I am a self-taught learner of web development and English, so I will be so thankful for your help and suggestions.

### Continued development

I do not feel comfortable with my current job. I believe I should review several concepts such as linear gradients, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and other topics. If you could provide me with suggestions on these, I would be extremely grateful.
